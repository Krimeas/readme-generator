## Description
A quick and easy way to generate a high quality readme by answering a series of questions.  By opening the terminal in throught the folder associated with this project.  From there, by typing 'node index.js' and hitting enter/return the questions will appear one after the other.  Once you have made it through the questions a high quality readme file will be written to the subfolder where the JS file is saved. 



## Assigned Tasks
  1. Write a Javascript file that uses inquirer to prompt questions to the user.
  2. write up a series of prompts that will apply the given answers to data that will then be written to a Readme file.
  3. Create and apply a video showing instructions on how to use the application.
